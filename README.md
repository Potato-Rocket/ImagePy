# ImagePy
A simple tool written in python to get a color scheme from an image.

This project is still in its early develompent stages, so documentation will be created later. However, the code (Scheme.py) is heavily commented if you want to check it out and give suggestions.

The goal is to provide a tool that creates a color scheme that reflects all the colors in an image by thoroughly analyzing it. It will also be able to write directly to a user defined set of config files, eg. a terminal or WM config file.
